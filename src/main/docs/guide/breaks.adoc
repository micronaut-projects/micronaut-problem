=== Micronaut Problem JSON 3.0.0

Starting with Micronaut Framework 4.0.0, Micronaut Problem JSON is based on `jakarta.validation` rather than `javax.validation` as in previous versions.

It is necessary to <<codec,specify `application/problem+json` as an additional type for the JSON codec>>.

=== Micronaut Problem JSON 2.2.3

The default Problem+JSON payload does not include the `detail` field to avoid accidental information disclosure if the exception root cause is not of type `UnsatisfiedRouteException` or `ThrowableProblem` to avoid accidental information disclosure since 2.2.3.

You can <<customizingProblemErrorResponseProcessor, customize it>> to include always the detail or for some scenarios.
